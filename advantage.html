				<p>
				Windturbine has cost about €1 million and a grant of €427,000 was given by Sustainable Energy Ireland.
				The turbine currently generates approximately €130,000 in financial benefits to the college per annum. 
				</p>
				<p>
				If turbine non-stop working for 13-years there will be 1,690,000 euro financial benefits to college. It nearly 2million, that is huge amount grand.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Over the past 13 years, the DkIT turbine has consistently delivered between 1.3 and 1.6 million units (kWh) of electricity on an annual basis depending on winds in a given year. Approximately 80% of the annual electricity generated by the turbine is consumed directly by the Institute which avoids electricity purchases from the grid at retail electricity rates. The remaining 20% is exported to the grid. Exports arise when Institute demand is low such as on windy nights and weekends.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The typical lifespan of a wind turbine like that at DkIT is 20 years. In light of the recent refurbishment, the Institute’s turbine is expected to exceed this. Considerations for its future development are under examination by management at the Institute.
